# cysip â€” GitHub Pages site

This repository contains the static website for cysip.

Deployment
- GitHub Pages source: main branch / root
- The site entry point is `index.html`.
- Custom domain: `www.cysip.com` (CNAME already added to the repository)

1. git clone https://github.com/aishacyprus-dot/cysip.git
2. make changes to `index.html` (or other files)

- A `.nojekyll` file is included to prevent Jekyll processing.
